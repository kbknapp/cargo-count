Linux: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbknapp/cargo-count.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbknapp/cargo-count)

A cargo subcommand for displaying line counts of source code in projects, including a naive `unsafe` counter for Rust source files. This subcommand was originally based off and inspired by the project [tokei](https://github.com/aaronepower/tokei) by [Aaronepower](https://github.com/aaronepower)

## Demo

To count the source code in the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) repository (checkout `4c99649`), and print some naive statistics on how much "unsafe" code exists.

**NOTE:** The Rust repository is quite large, if you're on a slow internet connect consider using a smaller repository, such as the `cargo-count` repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
$ cd rust
$ cargo count --separator , --unsafe-statistics
Gathering information...
         Language    Files  Lines    Blanks  Comments  Code     Unsafe (%)
         --------    -----  -----    ------  --------  ----     ----------
         Rust        6,018  528,510  66,984  133,698   327,792  3,163 (0.96%)
         C           54     9,962    1,445   1,492     7,025    7,025 (100.00%)
         CSS         4      1,266    149     52        1,065    
         JavaScript  4      1,118    131     166       821      
         Python      31     4,797    843     585       3,369    
         C Header    13     1,865    284     585       996      996 (100.00%)
         C++         4      1,611    185     81        1,345    1,345 (100.00%)
         --------    -----  -----    ------  --------  ----     ----------
Totals:              6,128  549,129  70,021  136,659   342,413  12,529 (3.66%)

```

The `--separator ,` sets a `,` character as the thousands separator, and `--unsafe-statistics` looks for, and counts lines of `unsafe`.

## Installing

`cargo-count` can be installed with `cargo install`

```
$ cargo install cargo-count
```

This may require a nightly version of `cargo` if you get an error about the `install` command not being found. You may also compile and install the traditional way by followin the instructions below.


## Compiling

Follow these instructions to compile `cargo-count`, then skip down to Installation.

 1. Ensure you have current version of `cargo` and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed
 2. Clone the project `$ git clone https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-count && cd cargo-count`
 3. Build the project `$ cargo build --release` (**NOTE:** There is a large performance differnce when compiling without optimizations, so I recommend alwasy using `--release` to enable to them)
 4. Once complete, the binary will be located at `target/release/cargo-count`

## Installation and Usage

All you need to do is place `cargo-count` somewhere in your `$PATH`. Then run `cargo count` anywhere in your project directory. For full details see below.

### Linux / OS X

You have two options, place `cargo-count` into a directory that is already located in your `$PATH` variable (To see which directories those are, open a terminal and type `echo "${PATH//:/\n}"`, the quotation marks are important), or you can add a custom directory to your `$PATH`

**Option 1**
If you have write permission to a directory listed in your `$PATH` or you have root permission (or via `sudo`), simply copy the `cargo-count` to that directory `# sudo cp cargo-count /usr/local/bin`

**Option 2**
If you do not have root, `sudo`, or write permission to any directory already in `$PATH` you can create a directory inside your home directory, and add that. Many people use `$HOME/.bin` to keep it hidden (and not clutter your home directory), or `$HOME/bin` if you want it to be always visible. Here is an example to make the directory, add it to `$PATH`, and copy `cargo-count` there.

Simply change `bin` to whatever you'd like to name the directory, and `.bashrc` to whatever your shell startup file is (usually `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`)

```sh
$ mkdir ~/bin
$ echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
$ cp cargo-count ~/bin
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows

On Windows 7/8 you can add directory to the `PATH` variable by opening a command line as an administrator and running

```sh
C:\> setx path "%path%;C:\path\to\cargo-count\binary"
```

Otherwise, ensure you have the `cargo-count` binary in the directory which you operating in the command line from, because Windows automatically adds your current directory to PATH (i.e. if you open a command line to `C:\my_project\` to use `cargo-count` ensure `cargo-count.exe` is inside that directory as well).


### Options

There are a few options for using `cargo-count` which should be somewhat self explanitory.

```
USAGE:
    cargo count [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [ARGS]

FLAGS:
    -S, --follow-symlinks      Follows symlinks and counts source files it finds
    -a, --all                  Do not ignore .gitignored paths
                               (Defaults to false when omitted)
    -h, --help                 Prints help information
        --unsafe-statistics    Displays lines and percentages of "unsafe" code
    -V, --version              Prints version information
    -v, --verbose              Print verbose output

OPTIONS:
    -l, --language <exts>...    Only count these languges (by source code extension)
                                (i.e. '-l js py cpp')
    -e, --exclude <paths>...    Files or directories to exclude (automatically includes '.git')
        --utf8-rule <rule>      Sets the UTF-8 parsing rule (Defaults to 'strict')
                                 [values: ignore lossy strict]
    -s, --separator <sep>       Set the thousands separator for pretty printing

ARGS:
    to_count...    The files or directories (including children) to count
                   (defaults to current working directory when omitted)

When using '--exclude <path>' the path given can either be relative to the current 
directory, or absolute. When '<path>' is a file, it must be relative to the current 
directory or it will not be found. Example, if the current directory has a child 
directory named 'target' with a child fild 'test.rs' and you use `--exclude target/test.rs' 

Globs are also supported. For example, to exclude 'test.rs' files from all child directories 
of the current directory you could do '--exclude */test.rs'.
